  gameText: You take the bounty and head out to look for the target. You find him
    camping out in the woods near town. He is so drunk that he passes out leaving
    you with an open target. You successfully take him out and retrieve your 70,000
    gold. You move into a castle to the south and live out the rest of your days.
