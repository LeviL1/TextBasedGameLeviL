  gameText: You show up to an iron mine with nothing but a old pickaxe in tow.  You
    enter the mine to see many others trying to find iron. You start smacking an
    vein of iron ore when you hear a loud blast. Someone used explosives to mine
    and ended up collapsing the hole thing. You are crushed under the rubble. Left
    to restart.
